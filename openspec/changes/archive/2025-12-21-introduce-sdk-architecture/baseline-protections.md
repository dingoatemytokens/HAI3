## 8. Dependency Graph

```
Modules: 1067
Dependencies: 967
Violations: 0
```

---

## Migration Acceptance Criteria

After SDK architecture migration is complete, the following MUST be true:

1. **All baseline checks still pass** - No new violations
2. **Unused exports count unchanged or lower** - Migration should not increase
3. **New SDK packages have layered protection** - Each layer has appropriate rules
4. **Protection coverage expanded** - New packages have MORE protection than before
5. **No ts-ignore/ts-nocheck** - Migration must maintain strict typing

---

## Verification Command

Run after migration to verify no regression:

```bash
npm run lint && npm run type-check && npm run arch:check && npm run arch:deps && npm run arch:unused
```

All must pass with 0 errors and 0 warnings.

## Post-Migration Verification (2025-12-16)

### Summary

| Check | Pre-Migration | Post-Migration | Status |
|-------|--------------|----------------|--------|
| ESLint | 0 errors | 0 errors | ✅ PASS |
| TypeScript | 0 errors | 0 errors | ✅ PASS |
| Arch:deps | 0 violations | 0 violations | ✅ PASS |
| Unused exports | 20 | 20 | ✅ PASS |
| SDK Layer Tests | N/A | 24 tests | ✅ NEW |
| Layer Config Tests | N/A | 33 tests | ✅ NEW |

### New Protections Added

1. **SDK Layer Protection** (24 tests in `npm run arch:sdk`)
   - Zero @hai3 dependencies in SDK packages
   - Framework only depends on SDK packages
   - React only depends on Framework
   - No deprecated package dependencies

2. **Layered Config Verification** (33 tests in `npm run arch:layers`)
   - ESLint configs at each layer properly extend base
   - Dependency cruiser configs at each layer properly extend base
   - SDK layer restrictions enforced
   - Screenset protection rules preserved

3. **Package-Level Protection Configs** ⚠️ NEEDS RE-ASSESSMENT
   > See [proposal.md Issue 2](./proposal.md#issue-2-eslintdepcruise-decomposition-misunderstanding). This approach conflates monorepo-level (SDK source code) vs user-level (shipped to users) protection. Phase 13.2 in tasks.md addresses this.
   - Each SDK package has its own eslint.config.js
   - Each SDK package has its own .dependency-cruiser.cjs
   - Configs enforce layer-appropriate restrictions

### Sign-Off

**All existing protections preserved and enhanced.**

- Original 6 arch:check tests still pass
- 57 NEW tests added (24 SDK + 33 layers)
- All baseline violation counts unchanged
- No regressions detected
