/**
 * HAI3 Dependency Cruiser Configuration (Standalone)
 * Base rules for HAI3 projects - screenset isolation and flux architecture
 *
 * This is a SELF-CONTAINED configuration that includes all rules inline.
 * It does NOT depend on @hai3/depcruise-config (which is monorepo-only internal tooling).
 *
 * Rules included:
 * - L0 Base: Universal rules (no-circular)
 * - L4 Screenset: Screenset isolation and flux architecture rules
 *
 * This is the single source of truth for standalone project dependency rules.
 * - CLI copies this to new projects via copy-templates.ts
 *
 * Note: Uses $1, $2 for backreferences (not \1, \2) per dependency-cruiser docs
