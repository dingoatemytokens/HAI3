# Quick Start Guide

## First Time Setup

1. Open terminal in your project folder
2. Run: `npm install`
3. Run: `npm run dev`
4. Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser
5. Run: `npm install -g @hai3/cli@alpha` (enables screenset scaffolding commands)
6. Run: `npm install -g @fission-ai/openspec@latest` (enables AI to manage proposals)
7. Ask the AI: "Set up Chrome DevTools MCP server so you can see my browser"

## Creating Your First Screenset

### Step 1: Start Your AI Assistant

Open this project in one of these AI-powered editors:
- **Claude Code**
- **Cursor**
- **Windsurf**

### Step 2: Create a Draft Screenset

Type this command in your AI chat:

```
/hai3-new-screenset
```

The AI will ask you:
- **Name**: Give it a simple name like `dashboard` or `settings`
- **Category**: Choose `Drafts` (you can promote it later)
- **Initial screens**: Start with just one, like `home`

### Step 3: Review and Approve

The AI will create a proposal showing what it plans to build.

**Happy with it?** Apply the proposal:
```
/openspec:apply add-{your-screenset-name}
```

**Want changes?** Tell the AI what to adjust before applying:
- "I want fewer screens"
- "Use a different name"
- "Add a settings screen too"

### Step 4: See Your Work

Your new screenset appears in the HAI3 Studio screensets selector. Click to open it.

## Adding More Screens

To add a screen to your screenset:

```
/hai3-new-screen
```

## Making Changes

Describe what you want to the AI in plain language:
- "Add a button that shows a greeting"
- "Create a form with name and email fields"
- "Show a list of items from the API"

## If Something Goes Wrong

After applying, if the result isn't what you wanted:
- Ask the AI to fix it: "Remove the sidebar" or "Change the layout"
- Undo everything: "Undo the last changes" or use your editor's undo

## Checking Your Work

Before sharing your work, ask the AI to validate it:

```
/hai3-validate
```

The AI will check your code and report any issues.

## Getting Help

- Type `/hai3-quick-ref` for common patterns
- Type `/hai3-rules` to see guidelines for a topic
- Ask your AI assistant any question about the project

## Workflow Summary

```
Draft → Mockup → Production
```

1. **Draft**: Quick experiments, AI-generated
2. **Mockup**: Refined designs, human-reviewed
3. **Production**: Final, tested, ready for users

Start with drafts. Promote what works.
